								Evil Born of Love is a visual novel that uses Twine text-based framework in conjunction
								with looping 3D animations created in Blender. The novel deals with themes of growth,
								identity, spirtuality, and overcoming hardship.
								The 3D visuals are used as a backdrop while players
								 process each segment of the story, deciding which paths to take. <br><br>

							<p> For the project I created over 50 seamless looping animations with modeled, rigged, and animated human and animal characters placed in custom environments with
								architectural and natural elements.
								In order to fit the emotional themes and warped narration style, I animated shader properites, scene and world lighting, and camera properties. 
								Non-looping animations were utilized to move players to new environments and for key plot moments.

							<p>The
								game was created as a project for the senior sequence <br>in the Art and Design,
								Games/Playable Media department at U.C. Santa Cruz. <p>A compilation of all the animations made for the game can be seen below. <br>The full game can be
									played on <a href="https://vincentb162.itch.io" target="_blank">my Itch.io page</a>.</p>

							<!-- <p>The game takes place in a rural small town, where you engage in day-to-day activites. A
								distanced, warped narration guides you through the world. The expection
								for a standard visual novel progression through hyperlinks is manipulated through the
								pacing of the plotline as well as the distorted narration style. For example, players
								find
								they must press individual buttons to lift food to their mouth, chew, and then swallow.
								The distortion of the game universe progresses as space itself warps to reveal a sphinx
								living in the player's cupboard, who then guides the player through their growth and
								healing process.
								
								In the latter half of the game, imagery becomes more abstracted and the forest shifts
								into a mental landscape
								where items must be collected through conversation directly with the narrative voice of
								the game.
								The sphinx guides the player as they explore strange landscapes and collect bodies from
								the earth - the
								release of the bodies is negotiated through conversation directly with the narrative
								voice of the game.
								The player is informed that the bodies are representative of parts of themselves that
								must be given up to
								the sphinx in order for them to heal and grow.</p> -->
