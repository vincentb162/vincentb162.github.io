												<p>Art Tool is a digital painting tool made in Phaser 3 using Javascript. The tool allows for rapid creation of abstract patterned images.
													Users can explore a mixture of standard drawing tools (brush and canvas color, brush size, erasers) along with various 
													automated and distorted effects.<br><br><b>Effects include: </b>automated scaling of brush size, rotation of brush location, scaling and transparency control of overlayed canvases, and painting with the brush texture set to the current canvas image.
													<br><br>All visual assets were created in Gimp, and audio created in Logic Pro. <br><br>Art Tool is avaliable to <a href="https://vincentb162.itch.io/drawing-tool" target="_blank">use on Itch.io</a>

												I created 24 different buttons that interact in various ways, setting the logic for each button to account 
												for various other effects that might already be turned on. When the mouse is clicked and dragged over the 
												canvas element of the interface, the texture/opcacity of the brush stroke is determined by the state of the buttons. 
												The tool then accounts for the states of automated effect buttons (which can automated scaling, rotation, mirroring, movement)
												as it draws the brush stroke to the screen. Over 90 UI assets were created by hand to complete the control panel and give buttons various 
												appearances while they are in different states.

													The Tool can be used as a standard basic drawing software. However- through experimentation users discover that the combination of automated effects causes their painted image to quickly evolve into a transforming landscape of patterns that will move with minimal user input. Automated effects will drag and warp color
													around the screen with very little mouse movement. <b>This makes the 
													Art Tool useful for generating live visuals for performances, or simply as a transforming visualizer to play with and watch.
													

												The page is split with a canvas on the left side, and all controls and effects on the right.
												The tool encourages slow exploration of the various effects and how they interact with each other, drawing influence from digital synthesizers and early internet art software. 
												The control panel buttons are designed to hint at the effects they provide rather than fully explain their functions, which encourages users to play with the tool, gradually learning how to control the tool how they want. Through its interface and strange selection of effects, Art Tool creates a carefree environment 
												for users to explore the possibilties of abstract pattern-based artwork.
